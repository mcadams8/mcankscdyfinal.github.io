            Chef Russo was an absolute delight! My kids have been going on about her empanadas for weeks, so I might just have to 
            ask her to come over and cook for us again. Quality service and company.

            Chef Odhiambo treated us for my daughter's Sweet 16 because she LOVES Italian, and he did not disappoint. Great overall service as well; 
            not a misplaced pan or plate. Will certainly be using this service again for the next occasion!

            Best. Mediterranean. Food. Ever. Febrian was a delight, and his falafels are sooo scrumptious. My husband won't stop raving about them.
            You can tell these guys have years of experience, but they're super humble and classy about their talent. This service and its employees are a godsend,
            I will definitely be back for seconds.

            Never knew private chef shopping was a thing, but this business is great. My dad turned 80 last weekend and I hadn't seen him look
            that happy eating in so long, so guess I have the guys at GP Chef to thank. Chef Sevkovic is welcome at our home any time.
